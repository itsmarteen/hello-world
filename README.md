      <h1>I am starting my coding journey, self-taught.</h1>
      <p>I am developing the skills/knowledge to become a valuable member of a front-end web developing team. Currently, I am working on HTML5, CSS, and will soon start JAVASCRIPT. I am working on open source curriculums like freeCodeCamp.com, theodinproject.com, and codecademy.com. I am excited to learn alongside other developers and begin expanding my language repertoire.</p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently working as a bartender at a fast-paced bar in Seattle, WA. I own too many plants and have two cats name'd Beelzebub and Lucifer.</p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>I want to become a proficient enough front-end web developer to be able to make the switch from hospitality to tech. I hope to meet new developers, mentors, leaders, and friends.</p>
